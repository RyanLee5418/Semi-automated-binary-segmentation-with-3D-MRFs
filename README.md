# Semi-automated-binary-segmentation-with-3D-MRFs
 Base on existing literature on Bayesian matting and employs NUKE software to construct a binary color keying system, this system is used to process frames of images and obtain the alpha matting as the result, which is used to implement the synthesis of the foreground and new background of an image within a spatial and temporal scale.

# Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness of binary color keying in processing visual content and examines the factors that influence the matting effect, including performance differences between 2D, 3D MRF, and MRF with motion compensation. The project builds on existing literature on Bayesian matting and employs NUKE software to construct a binary color keying system. The system is used to process five frames of images, and multidimensional tests are conducted to evaluate its performance. The project effectively explores the influence of variables and factors and identifies improved methods for enhancing the matting effect. Overall, this project provides insights into the performance of binary color keying and offers practical recommendations for improving matting effects in visual processing.
